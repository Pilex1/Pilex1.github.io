## About this place

Hello, you've stumbled upon my personal website! 

Here you'll find a collection of various articles and interactive programs ranging from computer graphics, visualization, fractals, cellular automata, game development, and machine learning. The careful reader will realize that all these topics lie in the intersection between computer science and mathematics!

## About me

I recently graduated from University of Sydney in mathematics and computer science with first class honours and the university medal. 

In my honours thesis, supervised by [Dr. Cl√©ment Canonne](https://ccanonne.github.io/), I proved a novel theoretical result in machine learning via tools from information theory. Specifically, I proved that the expected generalisation error of learning halfspaces in $\mathbb{R}^n$ via their Fourier coefficients is $O\left(\sqrt{\frac{n\log m}{m}}\right)$ when using $m$ i.i.d. samples drawn uniformly from the $n$-dimensional Boolean hypercube, and $O\left(\sqrt{\frac{n}{m}}\right)$ when using i.i.d. samples drawn from the $n$-dimensional Gaussian density. You can read my full thesis [here](/assets/thesis.pdf).
