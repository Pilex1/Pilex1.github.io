## About this place

Hello, you've stumbled upon my personal website! 

I am currently an undergraduate student studying mathematics and computer science at University of Sydney. Here you'll find a collection of various articles and interactive programs ranging from computer graphics, visualization, fractals, cellular automata, game development, and machine learning. The careful reader will realize that all these topics lie in the intersection between computer science and mathematics!
