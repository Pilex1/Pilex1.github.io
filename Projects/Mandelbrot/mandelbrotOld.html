	<h1>Complex Numbers and Fractals</h1>
	<h3>Join Programming Club Now!</h3>
	<p>On the left hand side is the Mandelbrot Set and on the right is the Julia Set - they are both fractals!<br>Each point represents a complex number (with the frame representing an Argand diagram) - and this number is passed into a simple iterative complex-valued function.<br>The colours in the fractal represent the output of the function, with bands of the same colour indicating the same output value.<br>The remarkable thing is that although this function is incredibly simple, it produces an incredibly detailed shape (in fact, infinitely detailed!) - go ahead and explore yourself!</p>
	<h3>Controls</h3>
	<p>Move your mouse to select fractal<br>WASD - pan frame<br>IK - zoom in/out<br>JL rotate<br>ZXC + optional SHIFT - change colours<br>123456789 - change modes<br>R - reset<br>YH - increase/decrease level of detail (may cause loss in performance if increased too high)</p>
