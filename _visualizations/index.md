Cool looking visualizations are one of the most accessible ways to dip one's toes into the intersection between mathematics and computer science. Arguably the most iconic of all of these is the Mandelbrot set, and its slightly lesser known cousin the Julia set.

## Cellular automata

In the summer of 2021, I had the opportunity of participating in the [Science Summer Research Program](https://www.sydney.edu.au/scholarships/d/science-summer-research-program.html) at the University of Sydney. My project, supervised by Professor [Nalini Joshi](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Nalini_Joshi), was concerned with studying a certain class of cellular automata called parity filter automata. You can read my final report [here](/assets/denr final report.pdf).
