        <p>If you've stumbled across this mysterious page, one of the following has happened. Either, I have become really famous
            and you are admiring at my brilliant talents, or you are a rather curious but perhaps somewhat creepy individual
            who enjoys browsing through the personal websites of random people, or I have personally given you the link to
            this website for whatever reason. Or perhaps you do not fit into either of these three categories, in which case
            I really do not know how you got here.</p>

        <h2>About This Website</h2>

        <h3>
            <a href="index.html">Projects:</a>
        </h3>
        <p>A collection of various projects I have made, ranging from fractals to cellular automata. They have a largely mathematical
            focus.

        </h3>
        <p>A collection of the creative talent of our artist-in-residence, Mr. Xing Lin, otherwise known as
            <em>ToweringHorizon</em>, famous for his incredible MS Paint artworks. He is currently accepting requests for commissions.</p>

        <h3>
            <a href="index.html">The Dominion:</a>
        </h3>
        <p>What is
            <em>The Dominion</em>, you may ask? Well, I have no idea either. All I know is that it is in a constant state of
            emergency.
