This is a 2D game I developed during high school over the course of approximately one year as I was learning about OpenGL and programming in C#. It's heavily inspired by [Terraria](https://terraria.org/) and [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/).

Some of its features include 

- procedural terrain generation with different biome types e.g. oceans, forests, deserts
- dynamic terrain interaction e.g. ability to create and destroy tiles in the terrain
- coloured lighting engine
- fluid engine
- logic system e.g. wires, logic gates, etc. (think Minecraft redstone)
- entity system e.g. there's creatures that bounce around and try to kill you
- world saving and loading
